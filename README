Readme for module Chest
-----------------------

Simple module to store subroutines in a hash.

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install


What is the advantage over a normal hash?

Not much, only that it protects his core a little bit to contain
other things than subroutines.

You can subclass it and add special functions around a call.

I hope it spares at least some typing, when you came to
a point where you think, that a hash is good place for your 
subroutines.

Personally I use it to implement something like a global namespace
where I can everything can be called from every point. Ok, the function
that wraped the "take" method has to be imported before.

So I did not think that is a dispatcher. It could be used for that,
but 80% percent of the calls are constant.

Disadvantages are the decrement of execution speed.
